## 5. üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Milestones

### üü¢ Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Choose game engine and set up project
- [ ] Install required tools (e.g., Blender, Git, Python)
- [ ] Configure cross-platform build settings
- [ ] Create and test a basic export for all platforms

### üîµ Phase 2: 3D Prototype
- [ ] Import and display 3D character
- [ ] Add idle animation
- [ ] Implement basic camera and scene controls
- [ ] Create placeholder UI

### üü£ Phase 3: AI Integration
- [x] Decide AI method (LLM API / **local model** / rules)
- [ ] Set up communication between AI and game engine
- [ ] Use AI to trigger basic character behavior (e.g., animation, text response)
- [ ] Implement basic context memory or dialogue flow

### üü° Phase 4: Interaction Layer
- [ ] Add simple chat input/output system
- [ ] Add sound/voice support (TTS or voice lines)
- [ ] Animate based on emotions or dialogue type
- [ ] Improve character responsiveness

### üü† Phase 5: Polish & Export
- [ ] Improve UI and add visual feedback
- [ ] Package for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- [ ] Perform usability tests
- [ ] Create installable builds for sharing

## 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Challenges

| Risk                                      | Solution / Mitigation                           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AI latency too high                       | Use local model or async messaging              |
| Cross-platform bugs (macOS, Linux issues) | Test exports early; isolate platform-dependent code |
| Animation assets are low quality          | Use Mixamo / ready-made rigged characters       |
| Scope creep                               | Stick to MVP goals and document new ideas separately |
| Difficulty integrating AI + engine        | Start with test environment, simplify prototype |

## 8. üèÅ Success Criteria

The project is considered **"v1 complete"** when:
- [ ] 3D character is controllable by AI
- [ ] Emotion/mood expression
- [ ] Core features work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- [ ] Dialogue system or input/output is functional
- [ ] Basic UI/UX is in place
- [ ] No major bugs, smooth performance

Bonus "stretch" goals:
- [ ] Voice interaction
- [ ] Dynamic scene changes
